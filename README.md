## What

I initially wrote a ray tracer in C++ for Theodore Kim's class at Yale. However, due to pandemic panic, I felt I was never able to fully grasp the math, write clean code and do it justice. So I am starting over from scratch, hoping to implement all effects, while learning Go along the way :). Along with my class notes, I discovered Ray Tracer Challenge, and it seems a great reference.
